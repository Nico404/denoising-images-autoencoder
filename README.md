# denoising-images-autoencoder
Denoise images w/ CNN autoencoder Keras TF + OCR

This jupyter focus on the following Kaggle's challenge: 
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/denoising-dirty-documents

Here is a sample of what the neural network is able to do:

In this notebook, we build an autoencoder CNN with the Keras library.

- First, we do some data exploration and cleaning
- Second, we build our simple autoencoder and check how it performs
- Third, we perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on both noised and denoised images to compare performence
